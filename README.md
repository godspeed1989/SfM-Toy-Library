# Toy Structure From Motion Library using OpenCV

This is a reference implementation of a Structure-from-Motion pipeline in OpenCV, following the work of Snavely et al. [2] and Hartley and Zisserman [1].

## Compile

To compile use CMake: http://www.cmake.org

### Prerequisite
- OpenCV: http://www.opencv.org
- Eigen3: http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page
- SSBA & Sparsesuite: https://github.com/chzach/SSBA/tree/master/SSBA-4.0 (bundeled with the library in the '3rdparty' directory) (Now optional when using the USE_SSBA=OFF option)
- OPTIONAL: Qt 5.x (for the GUI) and libQGLViewer: http://www.libqglviewer.com/ for the 3D visualization of the point cloud

### How to make

- Optionally build SSBA-3.0, by compiling it from '3rdparty' directory, or use "-DUSE_SSBA=OFF" with cmake.
- If SSBA will not be used, the internal OpenCV bundle adjuster will be used, but Iâ€™ve had better luck with SSBA (I may be using the OpenCV bundle adjuster wrong, though).

#### On OSX Using XCode

	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake -DSSBA_LIBRARY_DIR=../../SSBA-3.0/build -G "Xcode" ..
	open SfMToyExample.xcodeproj
	
#### On Linux (or OSX)

	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake -DSBA_LIBRARY_DIR=../../SSBA-3.0/build -G "Unix Makefiles" ..
	make 

#### On Windows

Use Cmake's GUI to create a MSVC solution, and build it.

## Use

See http://www.morethantechnical.com/2012/02/07/structure-from-motion-and-3d-reconstruction-on-the-easy-in-opencv-2-3-w-code/

### Execute

	USAGE: SfMToyUI.exe <path_to_images> [use rich features (RICH/OF) = RICH] [use GPU (GPU/CPU) = GPU] [down/upscale factor = 1.0]

### Datasets

Here's a place with some standard datasets for SfM: http://cvlab.epfl.ch/~strecha/multiview/denseMVS.html
Also, you can use the "Crazy Horse" (A national memorial site in South Dakota) dataset, that I pictured myself, included in the repo.

## Troubleshooting

- If you get linker errors "mismatch detected for '_ITERATOR_DEBUG_LEVEL': value '0' doesn't match value '2' in Visualization.obj", you must make sure you are compiling vs. the right VTK static libs (Debug have "-gd" postfix, Release don't).
